# Goals

* Performance 
* Security
* Multithreading
* Embeddable
* Hot reloading 
* Node/Text Interoperability

The goal of the BraneScript project is to create "The programming interface for XR" by providing a framework that allows for an amazing developer experience when creating high-performance multithreaded experiences. 

We aim to do this by pioneering a hybrid approach to programming, where the author can choose to script behavior using a node-based visual scripting system, or by writing code, and allowing an author to switch between the two at any time. 

The visual representation will allow for more intuitive writing of usually complex behaviors such as multithreading and data-dependency management while code will allow for cleaner and easier writing of complex algorithms and data manipulation.

XR is a part of this in a few different ways. First and foremost, this programming framework is being built for use in an XR engine. This means it needs to be built with optimal performance as one of the highest priorities. But we desire to interface with XR in other ways as well, such as making a native XR editor, allowing experiences to be fully created while within them.

This must not take away from the desktop coding experience though - it should be just as easy to write code in BraneScript out of VR as it is in any other language. This is why the hybrid approach is so important - it allows for the best of both worlds.
